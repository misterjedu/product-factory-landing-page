              Today, given the economic and labor market conditions, the best
              and least risky way to invest is to invest in personal assets and
              skills. UI / UX Product Design Course covers all aspects of
              product design from product thinking and design to user-centric
              research and product research and business vision and digital
              marketing to product designers and creators, designing the
              end-user experience and interface of the product and how to
              deliver it. Includes. In this course, we have tried to use the
              presence of successful and experienced experts in each of the
              above mentioned areas to engage in more specialized interaction as
              a mentor. This course is project-oriented and participants in
              several product teams are working to improve their product
              quality. And then start competing with other teams in a healthy,
              learning-filled competition. Finally, after the final exam and
              competition, participants will be awarded a Certificate of Product
              Factory certification.

              This course has been attempted by zero people who are eager to
              learn product design, especially user experience and user
              interface, so it is not a prerequisite, but due to the limited
              capacity of the priority course with early enrolled people, others
              can participate in future courses. Obviously, the ability to use
              tools like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator as well as
              Microsoft Word, Excel tools, and of course a lot of enthusiasm and
              energy,

                In the second session, we will discuss service design, first
                discussing “What is a service?” Then we practice how to create
                the right conditions for them in the long run to stay loyal to
                our product based on the actual needs of our audience and to
                create solutions that will reduce the hassle of the user in the
                short run. We are also going to create a way to measure the
                performance of our product so that we can ensure the quality of
                the design solution’s performance.
